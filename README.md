# COMP 373 Project 1
Group: Neal McMahon, Nick Skaleski, Olivia Quinn

Facility: Apartment Building

Our program is intended to model a basic user interface for current and potential tenants of an apartment building. Users can 
view the different types of rooms in the building and information about them such as availability and pricing, view information
about the different facilities in the building, and lease an apartment. Current tenants can also submit a request for maintenance
or other assistance.

We have many ideas for further services our system could implement, however we scaled the project back for the sake of time. As an example 
of these add-ons we included the partially completed classes for a more robust tenant request system, which would record more details about 
assisstance requests and keep a history of these requests.

Documented bugs/imperfections: due to the interaction between multiple different systems and IDEs, some classes may appear twice in GitHub or
your code clone
